    """Represents the behaviour of a file cache.

    Once a CachePolicy object has been created (typically using the
    static constructor from_string, or one of the static properties for
    special policies), use the refresh_file() method to determine if a
    given file should be refreshed:

    if my_policy.refresh(my_cache_file):
        # refresh the cache file
    else:
        # no need for refresh

    Use the refresh() method to check an arbitrary timestamp against the
    policy (e.g. if the cached data is not in a file):

    if my_policy.refresh(timestamp_of_last_refresh):
        # refresh the data

        If positive, the 'max_age' parameter is the number of seconds
        after which a cached file should be refreshed. This parameter
        can also accept some special values:
        - 0 indicates refresh should always occur, regardless of the age
          of the file;
        - -1 indicates the cache should be cleared;
        - -2 indicates the cache should be disabled.

        It is recommended to obtain such special policies using the
        static properties REFRESH, RESET, and DISABLED, rather than
        calling this constructor. This allows comparing a policy
        against those pre-established policies as follows:
